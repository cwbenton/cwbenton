**`Statistics, Data Science, and Analytics`**

I am a graduate student at Kennesaw State University studying Data Science and Analytics with an undergraduate degree in Mathematics.
My interests include non-parametric statistical methods and their applications in data science. As a data-driven individual, I enjoy 
taking a challenging problem and providing a solution through the use of the data and software at my fingertips. For work, I intern for the
Department of Justice and focus on using data to assist with casework, as well as lecture mathematics, data science, and statistics. Outside
of work I enjoy running, programming, reading, and piano!
