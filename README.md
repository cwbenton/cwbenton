**`Statistics, Data Science, and Analytics`**

I am an undergraduate at Kennesaw State University reaching for a Bachelor's in Mathematics with a concentration in
Applied Statistics and Data Analysis. I would describe myself as a data-driven individual who enjoys taking a challenging
problem and providing a solution solely through the use of data and software at my fingertips. For work, I intern for the
Department of Justice and focus on using data to assist with casework. Outside of work I enjoy running, reading, playing video games,
 and teaching others the importance of statistics in our daily lives!
